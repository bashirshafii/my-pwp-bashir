					<p>I have mentored over 50 students over the past 5 years to start a career in IT/Software Development. My clients fall into two broad
					categories: Recent high school graduates/college students who would like to start a career in IT. The second category are typically people with college degrees
					who have established careers in a non-IT field. They are career-changers that would like to get into the IT/Software Development industry. Regardless
					of which category you belong to, I can help you develop a game plan and a learning path to achieve your career goals.</p>

								I was working in the Banking Industry for couple years, and I was looking to challenge myself and advance my career. Fortunately, I met Mr.Bashir Shafii, CTO of Black Swan Solution, Inc., and took a course from him in IT Business Analysis. Bashir helped me understand what it takes to become a Business Analyst and provided strategies in finding a Business Analyst job.
								I am thankful for the opportunity and currently working as a Business Analyst in a major Insurance company.

<!--						Second Testimonial -->

						<div class="col-md-4">

							<blockquote>

								I took the Microsoft Technology Associate - Network Fundamentals course at Black Swan Solutions in October 2017. My instructor, Bashir Shafii,  had real world experience and didn't just teach theory. I was able to pass the certification exam on my first attempt and with a very high score ,in large part, due to the course I took at this school.
								With the certification in hand, I was able to get a job as a Help Desk Technician. I highly recommend this instructor and school.

								I took the Microsoft Technology Associate - Network Fundamentals course at Black Swan Solutions in September 2017. The school is located in ideal location in Bloomington with plenty of parking and easy access by bus.
								They have a well-equipped computer lab. The instructors were very knowledgeable and took the time to break down complex concepts for students. Both my instructors - Taylor Kerber and Bashir Shafii - are IT professionals with tons of industry experience.
								I highly recommend this school to anyone who wants to get started in the IT industry!
