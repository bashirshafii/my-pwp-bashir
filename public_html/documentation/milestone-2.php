			<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
			<p>My personal profile page will consist of one page with links and in-page navigation.</p>
			<p><strong>Nav Section: </strong> A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Full Stack Web Developer. This will include my profile image as a logo that is to the top left of the page. On the right top of the page will be menu links to in-page sections.</p>
			<p><strong>Hero Image Section: </strong>This welcome message will be overlaid on a large background image of my home office setup or an open computer screen with lines of code running.</p>
			<p><strong>About Me:</strong> This section will detail my professional history, clients I have worked for, my formal education and projects I have worked on.
				It will show the programming languages and frameworks I am conversant in and the kind of clients I am looking to connect with.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Services:</strong>This section will highlight the three services I will be providing: Full Stack Web Development for small businesses and non-profits, Consulting and Training.
				The page will be divided into three equal columns with an image and a block of text below the image for each column. </p>
			<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>I want this to be an animated, responsive image gallery containing 3 examples of my most recent work.
				Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with iconography to represent the technology used.</p>

			<p><strong>Testimonials: </strong> This section will contain profile images and a few lines of testimonials from my happy clients.</p>

			<p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will contain a contact form, where potential clients can reach out to me by submitting their name, email and a brief message.</p>
			<p><strong>Footer section: </strong> This section contains icons and links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn and GitHub</p>
