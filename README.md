# Milestone1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.
## Feedback
Your purpose audience and goal is perfect. I was able to immediately able to tell who your target demographic was and what you hoped to accomplish. The styling was also a nice touch. It made reading your content easier and didn't make my eyes bleed.

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, and content are superb. This is the quality of work I would expect out of a jr developer working underneath me. I am disappointed in your git commit history. You only have a single commit for Milestone2a. That is unacceptable, you should have had at least five commits for the amount of content you pushed. I know Milestone2a is a little weird because you are creating images outside of PHPStorm, but I still want to see normal git hygiene.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are clear and easy to understand. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish and have a clear vision of what your website will look like. 
### Content Strategy
The content strategy is clear and complements your wireframes nicely. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish.
## Design Tips
 The biggest challenge facing you in development will be the amount of content you have. Make sure you have a clear content strategy and a plan to handle site navigation. For your responsive image gallery I recommend looking into FancyBox3. FancyBox3 should provide all of the needed functionality you laid out in the content strategy

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
